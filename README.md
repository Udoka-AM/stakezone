My journey with QuickNode began in 2022 when my technical social media threads caught the attention of the ecosystem. I connected with Nick, the head of growth at the time, on both Discord and X (formerly Twitter), and was even sent a gift box of QuickNode merchandise. This early interaction made me feel like I was already part of the QuickNode family.

Now in 2025, I've grown significantly in both expertise and experience, working across multiple blockchain ecosystems within execution within the African demograph. Throughout this journey, I've recognized a clear opportunity for QuickNode's product catalog in the African market.

Africa's developer ecosystem is experiencing rapid growth, with recent statistics showing impressive increases in active developers, millions entering blockchain technology, hundreds of products being launched (achieving strong user acquisition and transaction volumes), and millions in investment flowing across countries like Nigeria, Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa across various blockchain ecosystems.

Despite this tremendous growth, I believe QuickNode has yet to establish a strong presence in this territory. Having lived in Africa my entire life and traveled to Kenya and South Africa, I've spoken directly with developers across the continent to understand their pain points and market dynamics. My findings from these conversations, along with frequent discussions with developer communities in Rwanda and Uganda, reveal consistent patterns that aren't significantly different from what I observe in Nigeria. Of which I believe can be efficiently harnessed for business profits. 

The African market is ripe for QuickNode's product catalog. With proper strategy and execution testing over a defined period, I believe a focus on the African ecosystem could significantly boost QuickNode's revenue. I'm excited about the opportunity to directly contribute to this expansion and bring QuickNode's powerful infrastructure to a rapidly growing market that's ready for these solutions.
